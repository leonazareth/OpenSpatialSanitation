This repository contains **QGIS scripts** developed to support the methodology proposed in the thesis, which aims to **enhance early-stage sanitation planning** using **open-access spatial data**.

The proposed methodology is developed to help sanitation planners and other stakeholders, such as utilities and decision-makers, incorporate spatial data on sanitation planning.

By integrating datasets—like gridded population, streets and paths registers, and building footprints—these tools ease identifying context-appropriate sanitation solutions. 

This repository will also include documentation on installing and using the scripts and relevant information for effective planning.
