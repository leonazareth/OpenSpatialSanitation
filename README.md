This repository contains *QGIS scripts* developed to support the methodology proposed in the thesis, which aims to *enhance early-stage sanitation planning* using *open-access spatial data*.

The proposed methodology are developed to help sanitation planners and other stakeholders, such as utilities and decision-makers, better understand the spatial dynamics of sanitation projects.

By integrating datasets—like *gridded population*, *streets and paths registers* and *building footprints*—these tools streamline the process of identifying context-appropriate sanitation solutions. 

This repository will also include documentation on how to install and use the scripts and relevant information for effective planning.
